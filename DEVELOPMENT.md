# Development Log - Image Translation Tool

## Project Overview
Converting a working Jupyter notebook proof-of-concept into a production-ready web application with improved quality and user experience.

## Current Status: Phase 1 - Foundation Setup

### Completed:
- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ Project structure created (`core/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `assets/`)
- ✅ `.gitignore` configured for Python/Streamlit project
- ✅ README.md created with usage instructions
- ✅ Basic Streamlit app exists and functions

### Current Implementation Assessment:
**Existing Streamlit App (`streamlit_app.py`):**
- ✅ Working single-image upload and processing
- ✅ Basic OCR with EasyOCR (12 languages)
- ✅ Google Translate integration
- ✅ Simple inpainting with OpenCV
- ✅ Basic text placement with outline
- ✅ Before/after comparison view
- ✅ Download functionality

**Identified Issues from Notebook Analysis:**
1. **No OCR confidence filtering** - Processing low-quality detections
2. **Poor font matching** - Using system default only
3. **Basic inpainting** - Leaves artifacts on complex backgrounds
4. **No text editing** - Can't adjust positions after generation
5. **Single image only** - No batch processing
6. **No error recovery** - Limited error handling

## Development Plan

### Phase 2: Core Function Extraction & Improvement (Next)
1. Extract functions from `streamlit_app.py` into modular `core/` files
2. Implement OCR confidence filtering and text validation
3. Add smart font matching with language-specific fonts
4. Improve inpainting with content-aware techniques

### Phase 3: Enhanced Interface (Day 2-3)
1. Multi-image upload and batch processing
2. Interactive text editing with position adjustment
3. Real-time preview updates
4. Better error messages and user feedback

### Phase 4: Production Deployment (Day 3-4)
1. Comprehensive testing and validation
2. Performance optimization
3. Streamlit Cloud deployment
4. User testing setup

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture Choice: Streamlit
**Rationale:** Fast prototyping, built-in file upload, good for MVP validation
**Trade-offs:** Limited customization vs React, but perfect for initial testing

### OCR Engine: EasyOCR
**Rationale:** Multi-language support, reasonable accuracy, easy integration
**Future:** May add PaddleOCR or TrOCR for specific languages

### Translation: Google Translate
**Rationale:** Comprehensive language support, reliable API
**Future:** Add DeepL for European languages, Azure for enterprise

## Quality Improvements Roadmap

### High Impact (Phase 2):
1. **OCR Confidence Filtering:** Eliminate 60-80% of downstream errors
2. **Smart Font Selection:** Language-aware font matching
3. **Enhanced Inpainting:** Content-aware fill for better backgrounds

### Medium Impact (Phase 3):
1. **Text Position Editing:** Click-and-drag adjustment
2. **Batch Processing:** Handle multiple images efficiently
3. **Better Error Handling:** Graceful failure and recovery

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Advanced ML Models:** Custom inpainting models
2. **Font Detection:** Match original font styles
3. **API Integration:** RESTful API for developers
4. **Mobile Optimization:** Touch-friendly interface

## Performance Targets

### Current Baseline:
- **Processing Time:** ~10-15 seconds per image
- **Memory Usage:** ~500MB with models loaded
- **Accuracy:** ~70-80% (varies by image quality)

### Target Improvements:
- **Processing Time:** <8 seconds per image
- **Accuracy:** >85% with confidence filtering
- **User Experience:** <3 second feedback on all actions

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy:
- `main` - Stable, deployable code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/xyz` - Individual improvements
- `hotfix/abc` - Critical bug fixes

### Commit Standards:
- Clear, descriptive messages
- Link to issue numbers when applicable
- Include performance impact notes
- Document breaking changes

## Memory Preservation Strategy

### Documentation Requirements:
1. **Decision rationale** for all technical choices
2. **Performance benchmarks** before/after improvements
3. **User feedback** from testing sessions
4. **Deployment notes** and configuration details

### Progress Tracking:
- Update this file after each major milestone
- Commit frequently with detailed messages
- Tag releases with version numbers
- Maintain changelog for user-facing changes
