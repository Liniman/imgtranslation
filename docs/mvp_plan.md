# Image Translation MVP - Ship in 2 Weeks

## Week 1: Basic Web App (Streamlit)
- [x] Extract core functions from notebook
- [ ] Create simple Streamlit interface
- [ ] Add error handling for common failures
- [ ] Test with 10 different images manually

## Week 2: Polish & Deploy  
- [ ] Add progress indicators
- [ ] Handle edge cases (no text, large files, unsupported formats)
- [ ] Deploy to Streamlit Cloud
- [ ] Share with 5 real users for feedback

## Success Criteria:
- Can translate 80% of test images without crashes
- Average processing time under 30 seconds
- 3 non-technical users can use it without help

## What NOT to Build (Yet):
- User authentication
- Image history/gallery
- Batch processing
- Custom fonts/styling
- API endpoints
- Advanced ML models
- Microservices
- Canvas editing
- Real-time collaboration

## Next Phase (Only After 100+ Users):
